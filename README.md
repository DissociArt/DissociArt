# Hi, I'm DissociArt 🎨  
### Street Artist | Creator | Visionary  

Welcome to my profile! I'm a Melbourne-based street artist passionate about creating raw, emotional, and thought-provoking works. My art explores dissociative tones, brutal hypercolors, and edgy themes designed to challenge perspectives and inspire creativity.
